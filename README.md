Notes for trending!
===================

1. DO *NOT* abuse OR start a tirade against anyone by TAGGING THEM. 
Whether it's Airtel or Flipkart or anyone that you hate. 

2. If you see any tweets doing that, please don't trend them in any way.
We are baking a "Report Tweet" button so that it will be removed in the next refresh.

3. If you are angry at anyone for breaking NetNeutrality, just do gandhigiri :) 
Tell them to get well soon.

4. Keep it apolitical. You can tweet to individual MPs asking their view, 
but don't create US vs Them situation. Why ? See (http://goo.gl/qIwwcp)

5. On Twitter use any of #NetNeutralityIndia, #SaveTheInternet, #RightToPlay, #NetNeutrality
   On Facebook preferably #IndiaWantsNetNeutrality or #SaveTheInternet

6. May the Force and Source be with you! :)

Thanks!
